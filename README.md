# maze-generator-results
### The repository contains generated rectangular mazes. Labyrinths have an entrance and an exit. They are generated in JSON format.
The name of the file includes the difficulty of the maze (EASY, MEDIUM, HARD, EXTREME) as well as the height h and width w.
EXTREME labyrinths will be included in the repository because generating them takes a long time. On average, one in a million attempts is generated the right labyrinth.
